##JOKE:
Imagine you have been selected for a post in Google.
You are being welcomed in the office.
The people are on the way to show your office.
They show you your desk, it's beautiful.....
You are moving forward to see your desk properly.
When you reach there, You find yourself lying on floor near your bed.
You have a wound on your elbow and head.

Hactober fest!!!!!!!
